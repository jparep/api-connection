# External Network API Connection

##  Overview
This project implements a **modern ELT pipeline** using:
- **Snowflake Internal Staging** for raw JSON storage.
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)** for structured transformation.
- **GitLab CI/CD** for automated deployment.


The **External Network API Connection** refers to a capability that allows applications to:

- Connect to external APIs.
- Fetch JSON data.
- Convert the data to RAW format for further processing.

This functionality is particularly valuable in 2025 as systems increasingly require integration with diverse data sources.

**No external storage required (AWS S3, Delta Lake). Faster, cost-effective, and scalable.** ðŸš€
