# External Network API Connection

The **External Network API Connection** refers to a capability that allows applications to:

- Connect to external APIs.
- Fetch JSON data.
- Convert the data to RAW format for further processing.

This functionality is particularly valuable in 2025 as systems increasingly require integration with diverse data sources.
